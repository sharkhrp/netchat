📝 ReadMe: Python Netcat-Style Chat System
📌 Description:
This is a simple command-line based chat system using sockets in Python. It mimics the behavior of netcat (aka nc) by allowing two devices to communicate over TCP.

You’ll get two scripts:

server.py → The “listener” (like nc -l)

client.py → The “connector” (like nc IP PORT)

🔧 Requirements
Python 3.x

Two terminals or two devices on the same network (or use localhost for testing)
